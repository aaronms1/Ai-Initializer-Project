/**
 * <h1>{@link Dropdown}</h1> is a functional React component representing a dropdown menu.
 *
 * This component provides a toggleable dropdown menu with a button to control
 * its visibility. It uses the useState hook to manage the dropdown's open state.
 * When the button is clicked, the dropdown's visibility alternates between open
 * and closed.
 *
 * The dropdown menu contains a placeholder content area, which can be customized
 * based on the application's requirements.
 *
 * The component applies conditional CSS classes to handle the active state
 * styling of the dropdown menu.
