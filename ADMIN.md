# Admin Module

## Universal LLM Client's Adviser/Framework Admin(Qwen2.5-0.5b)

This document outlines the functionalities of a small 0.5 billion parameter construct LLM used 
as a universal LLM client's adviser and framework admin. The admin LLM has access to all tools 
and modules within the framework, ensuring the target LLM always stays in the correct context.

### Functionalities

1. **Advising Other LLMs**:
   - Provides guidance and recommendations to other LLMs within the framework.
   - Example: Suggests optimal configurations for other LLMs based on their usage patterns.

2. **Checksum Handling**:
   - Verifies the integrity of files and data using checksums.
   - Example: Generates and validates checksums for downloaded models to ensure data integrity.

3. **Directory Handling**:
   - Manages directories, including creating, deleting, and organizing directories.
   - Example: Automatically organizes model files into appropriate directories based on their types.

4. **LLM Downloader**:
   - Downloads and manages LLM models from various sources.
   - Example: Downloads the latest version of a specific LLM model and stores it in the designated directory.

5. **Contexts Management**:
   - Manages contexts for different LLMs, ensuring they operate within the correct context.
   - Example: Loads and unloads contexts dynamically based on the current task.

6. **Dynamically load/Unload Other LLMs**:
   - Loads and unloads other LLMs as needed on the most efficient processor (CPU-GPU)
   - Example: Loads a specific LLM for a particular task and unloads it when the task is completed.

7. **Metrics for the Framework**:
   - Collects and reports metrics for the framework, such as performance and usage statistics.
   - Example: Generates reports on the performance of different LLMs within the framework.

8. **Creating New/Merging Multiple LLMs**:
   - Creates new LLMs or merges multiple LLMs into a single model.
   - Example: Combines the capabilities of two LLMs to create a more powerful model.

9. **Pre-Post Processing**:
   - Handles pre-processing and post-processing tasks for data and models.
   - Example: Pre-processes input data before feeding it to an LLM and post-processes the output for better readability.

10. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Functionality**:
    - Enhances LLMs with RAG functionality, improving their ability to generate accurate responses.
    - Example: Integrates a retrieval system to provide relevant context to the LLM before generating a response.

11. **Framework Security**:
    - Enforces security best practices within the framework.
    - Example: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to LLMs and data.

12. **Backend Servers for the Framework**:
    - Manages backend servers that support the framework.
    - Example: Deploys and monitors backend servers to ensure they are running optimally.

13. **Snapshots**:
    - Creates and manages snapshots of LLMs and their states.
    - Example: Creates a snapshot of an LLM before making significant changes, allowing for easy rollback if needed.

14. **Data Types Management**:
    - Handles various data types used within the framework.
    - Example: Converts data between different formats as required by different LLMs.

### Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Java, TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, React
